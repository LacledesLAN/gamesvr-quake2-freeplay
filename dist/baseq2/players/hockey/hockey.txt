Model description       : 

Hey.... He's a hockey player!  The story here is quite simple.... As the war stretches 
on... and on, the supply of good marines is running out!  Mankind simply does not have 
an endless supply of top-notch fighting men and women.... and before they trusted their 
survival to half-assed fighting men and women, they went to the next best sourch of mean,
lean, nasty combatants.... Hockey players, of course!  They were outfitted with special
blades on their skates, enabling them to glide across any surface (lava still burns, though!)
and of course, they traded sticks for guns.... They may be hockey players, but they're not
stupid!


Other info              : 

Mr Hockey is my second QuakeII model so far.... other ideas are in the works, but too 
little time to work on them means I don't know when the next will be along... Mr Hockey
is a little simple in his animations, but I think the run and deaths work very well. He
has two team skins, CTF skins, and three blank coloured skins for you to use as a base 
for your own fav teams. I had planned to do the 'original six', but that plan got 
sidetracked and eventually trashed.

Editor used             : 3DS r4 (if its good enough for Paul and the boys...)
			  qMe for the md2 conversion
			  Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro
			  NPherno's skin tool.

Known Bugs              : He's not perfectly centered.... 3DS4 has a few probs with precicion
			  Other than that, I havn't found any problems yet.  I don't know
			  what the skins look like without 3D acceleration, but I hope
			  they work well.  One "bug" with the skin... any logo placed on his
			  helmet will be backwards on the one side - deal with it.

Build/Animation time    : Uncounted hours.... the longest part is exporting all the frames, 
			  one by one from 3DS4.
