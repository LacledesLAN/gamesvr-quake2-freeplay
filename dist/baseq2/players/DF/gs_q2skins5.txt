ALSO LOOK FOR MY GS_Q2CTFSKINS.zip! It is a collection of CTF skins I have found, made, or edited. :)

***Important***: I am not responsible if you mess up this, your quake, or anything else on your PC! Your actions are
	   	your own and I take no responsibility.

	The GunSmoke skin is my own personal skin.  This skin is 
a male-only skin, so you must put it in the male directory for it 
to work.  I made this skin because of my love for the cowboy skin in quake1. 
I never knew the name of the skin but thanks to whomever made it. 
And to those of you who told me "who cares" when I asked you, !#@^%!#^%#!~@!.
      -	You may use it, but please do not edit or 
change it in any way, and that includes the file name too.
      - Yes, more skins and the old ones redone at least the Bikini one was, it is now Leopardess
and I apoligize many, many times over for that lame skin and having it uploaded, especially to the quake women.
The skin match is Alot better on this one! Please delete the Bikini skin , It is a shame to me, quake, and skin makers everywhere! :)
      - The Casual skin is an example of a "Guys Dream" of casual armor for the female, but looks cool too!
      - The Muscle skin is a waist up show of muscles and of course blue jeans below, LOVE I the BIG BUCKLE!
      - The Creature skin is discribed in really only one way, um.... I was bored.
      - The TigerLady is an example of what I like to draw, kinda like animal people mixes, youll see.
      - The BlueJean skin is an attempt to put the female in normal clothing, still low cleavage! :)
      - The ZebraLady skin is yet another animal woman cross.
      - The Piratess skin is an attempt at well a woman pirate, I LIKE IT! So :P.
      - The Grizzly skin is this ongoing fascination I have with genetically spicing people and animals HAHAHA!
      - The Mail skin is well what else a Mailman for Quake2, someone had to do, and wouldve so I took the intiative.... hehe Disgruntled!								
New Skins:
      - The Faerie20 skin is the red faery with red wings now, this was my ctf_r base skin.
      - The Faerie21 skin is, TA-DA!!, a blonde faery! It has green in it a bit, blame it on cut and paste, but I liked it so it stayed.
      - The FaerieCTF skins are for ctf, I used faerie20 for my red skin and faerie5 for the blue, I also added cool World War II fighter plane type wing logos, hehe
      - The ShamblerCTF skins are for Ctf, I added wrist bands, Leggings, and a cool CTF LOGO Tatoo on the back!
      - The DF(dumbfighter) skins are for ctf, I just renamed them and added ID ctf logos. 
	
	And a mention of thanks to Chris Pimlott for his clrskn10.zip, They came in very useful again and again!
,Another mention of thanks to the Quake 1 maker of the optimus skin, I sampled it! (call me puff daddy of quake2!)
,A mention of thanks to the awesome creator of the female LEANN skin, I sampled the legs for my Piratess skin
,A mention of thanks to the creator of the Faerie model, THIS IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE MODEL! Although I dont have your name cuz who reads these things anyway?!
 ,Of course a mention of thanks to ID for all these wonderful things they give us to play with!

	****PLEASE NOTE****: The Every part of these skins is not completely made by me and/or my ability so dont message/mail 
me about stupid things such as how I copied yours, your buddies, or your Grandmother's roommates boyfriend's skin. 
If I feel I copied enough of your skin to be note worthy I will credit you above somehow or another. Thanks!
