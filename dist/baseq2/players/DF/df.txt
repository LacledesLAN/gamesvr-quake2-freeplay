DUMB FIGHTER model for Quake2!!!  :)

Just a kind of reoccuring doodle I used to draw, I used it in
a number of places, now DF's in Q2!

Installation:  Unzip the DF.Zip into your main quake2 directory,
               and it should unzip everything into its proper directory.

               If you have trouble getting it to show up in the
               multiplayer menu, make sure you have NO files
               (besides the directories) in quake2\baseq2\players!


Tools used:  LightWave 3D v5.5
             Adobe Photoshop 4.01
             NST
	     Qdata (modified by Ken D. Turner)
             Paint shop pro

Time spent:  6 days I guess
             It was pretty fun making the model,
             then the animation started to turn ugly,
             I rushed alot of the anims.
             But it was cool-  :)
             Just used this one for self-proof
             I can do it, my next ones should be
             alot better.
