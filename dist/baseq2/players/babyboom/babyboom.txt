BABY BOOM
---------

Name:		Baby Boom
Author:		Andy "BoogieMan" Craft
Email:		boogieman10@hotmail.com

Time spent:	Who knows?  I've been doin so much other stuff.
Editor:		Quake2 Model Editor v0.83
Description:	This is the baby that not even a mother could love.  He is a Quake2 player
		model that I started a long time ago.  But I soon got bored with it and I
		wasn't happy with it.  I scrapped the old version and restarted.  He is now
		supposed to be somewhat "cartoony" with exaggeration and snappy animation.

Installation:

	Unzip all the files into a subdirectory in your players directory called "babyboom"
	Then you can select the model in the multiplayer setup menu in Quake2.

Skins:

	babyboom.pcx - The original Baby Boom skin.
	ctf_b.pcx & ctf_r.pcx - The CTF skins for the model.
	devilchild.pcx - I selected all the faces in my editor once, and it looked awesome.
		So I took the Baby Boom skin, inversed it, and shaded it red.
	goblin.pcx - I thought this skin might be cool.
	idiot.pcx - This is just a joke skin.  If you don't get it, watch someone use it
		in the dark.

	Skins aren't really my thing, but I know that there are many people who like to
	make skins.  I know these skins are crap (I know what good would be, I just can't
	get there yet) but if you like to make skins, feel free to make as many skins as
	you want as long as you at least mail them to me or tell me were I can find them.

Comments:

	If you have any comments, I'd like to hear them.  Go ahead and mail them to me.
