Model description       : Wilma Flinstone.  Doesn't she look cute in her blue ctf dress?


Other info              : This model was requested by Michele of DC clan (www.dcclan.com) on the Q2pmp model ideas/requests/suggestions forum on 10/17/99.  I thought it might be fun to make it so I did.  I didn't want to spend too much time on it, I did the whole thing in 8.5 days.  If I wanted to spend more time on it, I would have animated her face, and I would have been more creative with her waves, but I'm happy with it how it is.  There will be vweps for this model eventually,  I just have to take the time to export and compile them all.  Right now she uses the Q2 shotgun.  It clips her arm a little, but I will fix that when (and if) I release the rest of the vweps.
For the animations, I didn't try to copy Wilma from the cartoon at all,  I didn't even watch the cartoon until I recorded the sounds.

Known Bugs              : weapon passes through arm a little, that'll be fixed if I release the vweps.  I should've modelled the mouth.  Her skin looks a little light in OpenGl but Wilma Flintstone is pretty light anyway.  I'm not happy with the jump sound, if anyone can find a similar sound that sounds better, send it to me.
