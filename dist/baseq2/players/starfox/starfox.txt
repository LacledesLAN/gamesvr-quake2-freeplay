Model Name              : Fox McCloud (StarFox)

installation directory  : quake2/baseq2/players/starfox

Author                  : FoX (Louis-Philippe Guilbert)
Email Address           : lp.guilbert@videotron.ca
Homepage		: http://pages.infinit.net/lorenzo
                          (check it out to see the Peppy Hare model!)

Model description       : "Starfox, we need your help! Andross has
			  declared war on Stroggos!" Introducing
			  Fox McCloud, leader of the Starfox team,
			  ready for deathmatch action. The model is
			  based on pictures taken from magazine articles,
			  posters, websites about Starfox. I tried making
			  it as close as possible to the original model.
			  (See behindthescenes.jpg)
			  
Other info              : I have recently graduated from the National
			  Animation and Design Center located in Montreal,
			  PQ, Canada (www.nad.qc.ca), a school dedicated
			  to 3D videogame artwork. I have made a quake1
			  PC for my final exam, and this is my 2nd quake
			  project. Putting this model into Q2 was tough,
		 	  as all my previous experience was with q1.
			  (That explains why I used 4 apps just to get
			  the skin done I guess :) ) By the way I invite
			  anyone to submit skins or vwep's for it! Just
			  E-mail me. Comments welcome :)

Additional Credits to   : Id Software, Nintendo for the original idea.

Thanks to               : Kinetix, makers of 3DS Max; the authors of QME,
			  NST, Qmodeller and Studio MDX for their
			  kick-ass work. Ridah for the Eraser bots.
			  the Planetquake network for existing.

* Play Information *

New Sounds              : No (but it would rock)
CTF Skins               : Of course yes.
VWEP Support            : Yes. Well, um, uh, read the Bugs section.

* Construction *

Poly Count              : 636 polys
Vert Count              : 354 Verts
Skin Count              : 1 skin, plus red and blue ctf skins = 3 (really)

Base                    : New model from scratch (I don't see how I
			  could've modified the male player to look like
			  that :P )

Editor used             : 3D Studio Max 2.0 for modeling and animating
			  Paintshop Pro 5 for the skins
			  QME, NST, Qmodeller, Studio Mdx for quake-stuff

Known Bugs              : VWEP: this model was not modeled with vwep in
			  mind. doh. The way the stand animation is set up,
			  any weapon put in his hand sticks out of the
			  bounding box by a large amount (too much if you
			  ask me). So to avoid the dreaded GL diapers
			  with non-vwep models, I have made vwep files
			  all containing the same hand gun until I find
			  a way to resolve this matter.
			  Also, the skin has 50% wasted space, which is
			  pretty high, as I said this is my first q2
			  modeling experience and I am not yet very good
			  at optimizing skin space. Same with the gun.
			  Most likely, a new version will be released
			  when I solve these problems.

Build/Animation time    : Build time, a cool 3 hours and a half. (yay)
			  Animation time, mmm, a week. (ok)
                          Time to put into Q2, 1 week and a half. (eek)

* How to use this model *

Unzip, Unrar, Untar, unarj, unwhatever this archive under your
\quake2\baseq2\players\ folder, under the folder name \starfox\.
(full path then becomes \quake2\baseq2\players\starfox )

If the model does not show up in the multiplayer setup menu, check to
make sure there are no files in \quake2\baseq2\players\ , then verify
if the model file (tris.md2), pcx skin images and vwep md2's are present
in \starfox\ . Compare with another already-installed model. If this does
not make it work, go to http://www.planetquake.com/q2pmp, in the
Development Central, Troubleshooting section for more information and 
solutions to your problem.

(You've read so far? Ok here's a scoop, i'm planning to do a Rocko model,
you know, from Rocko's Modern Life? That show is sooo good. It's already
in the works, model coming along nicely.)
