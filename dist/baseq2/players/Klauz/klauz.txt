    Klauz is a plugin player model for Quake2.  The model is all 
    new, and the animations have all been replaced.  There is a 
    new skin (...), a new weapon and weapon skin.  There is also 
    a player Icon.

    Klauz began as a Quake homage to the classic "Lobo's Christmas 
    Special" comic book by Simon Bisley and Kieth Giffen.  In Quake 
    - with the short range weapons, he had a pair of kick-butt 
    knives.  With the release of Quake2 I decided to release Klauz
    as a Player model, and the knives were removed and replaced with 
    a big gun.

    So - here he finally is.  2 months late.  Just in time to frag
    that friggin' Saint Patrick's day leprachaun.  Perhaps that's 
    what my next model will be ... either that or something that 
    conveys the undeniable Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny!!  [hi CV]

    Ok, so he's a bit bright!  Like a big red target.  Oh well ... what
    can you do - I had to use red!

Installation:

Unzip the file into your Quake2 directory.  I put 
       Quake2/baseq2/players/klauz/
in the file with pathnames ... if you didn't install Quake2 in a 
directory called Quake2 you're going to have to do some file 
juggling.

You will only see other people playing with him if they happen to 
have Klauz on their harddrive, and vice versa.  w/o the model on 
their system, you will look like the default male player to 
potential frags.

Specs:

        Polygons:   442 Klauz
                    68  Weapon

    The skin is 256x128 but it isn't (by any stretch of the imagination) 
    optimized.  I would have loved to make use of all that space, but
    I just did not plan far enough ahead.  Oh well - a learning 
    experience ...

    Use him, kill him, kill with him, just don't prift from him.  You may not
    include this model in any compilations without my consent.

    PLEASE make skins for him.  I'd love to see that.  I decided to go with
    that deep red - which leaves me only 2 shades of red to blend with.  
    Bad choice by me.

    I may try to remap the vertexes on the skin if I chosoe to go back and
    work on this some more.  If someone else decides too ...

    Skinning is not my strong suit quite yet - still learning -
    and the one I put in there does not really do him justice.  It's more
    of a "Sweaty Klauz" than anything ...
